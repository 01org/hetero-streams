The Makefile in this folder shows the simplest possible ways to compile an 
hstreams program. It creates both the executable and sink side shared library
in the folder where the source code reside. Therefore, to be able to run them
we need to add the present working directory to the library paths.

The required setup has been shown in solution_run.sh file. 

The exercise in this tutorial is to remove extraneous staffs from the 
Makefile_original file, which has been used in all other tutorials. 
This file is generic enough to accommodate everything covered in the entire 
tutorial. You should still keep that generic for serve your need, and should be 
able to use it to compile other new your programs.
