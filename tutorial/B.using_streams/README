This is the README for B.using_streams
Please look at the README a level up from here first, for an overview.

Folder Name: 1.straight_line_cost_host
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This starting-reference code shows:
 The original straight line code.
 Shows how to time sections of interest
 There is no exercise to perform

The files in this directory are:
 Makefile
 names.mk
 rootname.mk
 run.sh
 solution_run.sh
 straight_line_code_host_src.cpp
 straight_line_code_host_src_original.cpp
 straight_line_code_host_src_solution.cpp
There is no difference in source code in the _src, _original or _solution files
 But they are there to maintain consistency.

Folder Name: 2.task_code_host
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This exercise shows:
 a. How to re-factor straight line code as tasks
 b. Variables become arguments

The files in this directory are:
